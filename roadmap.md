1.	Modular Component Design: Ensure each page type (service, origin, tag) has a modular component to streamline reusability across different index and individual pages. This will simplify future updates and maintain consistency.
2.	Efficient Sitemap Generation: Since the roadmap aims for 5k+ pages, set up automated sitemap generation with pagination, breaking into multiple sitemaps (1k URLs per sitemap) to stay within Google’s indexing limits and enhance SEO.
3.	Dynamic Slug Management:
o	Manage slugs carefully to avoid dynamic route conflicts by uniquely naming each route (e.g., /route/[route_id] vs. /location/[location_id]).
o	Where possible, use query parameters to distinguish between routes to prevent errors and ensure scalability.
4.	Enhanced SEO Strategy:
o	For programmatic SEO, create unique meta tags, titles, and descriptions for each service and location page. Incorporate specific keywords like “water damage restoration Brisbane” into H1 tags and meta descriptions.
o	Generate pages with exact match phrases based on likely user searches to maximize organic ranking potential.
5.	Data Integrity and Error Handling:
o	Add checks to handle null or malformed API responses, especially when interfacing with OpenAI GPT-4o-mini. This will prevent data gaps and improve user experience.
o	Optimize the error handling in TypeScript, logging errors effectively to debug API limitations or build issues quickly.
6.	JSON Data Organization:
o	Organize JSON files for individual and index pages, storing them in a logical folder structure (e.g., /data/regions, /data/services). This will facilitate quick data retrieval and efficient build processes.
7.	Static Generation Optimization:
o	Use ISR (Incremental Static Regeneration) to rebuild pages quickly, updating only those requiring frequent changes while preserving cache for unchanged pages. This will significantly reduce build times.
8.	Automated Build Process:
o	Streamline the build process by using npm run generate-data to automate data fetching and content generation. Consider batching API requests with rate limits to fit within the GPT-4o-mini’s high limit of 40k calls per minute.
9.	User Experience Enhancements:
o	Utilize Tailwind CSS and shadcn for styling, ensuring a responsive and visually appealing layout across devices.
o	Include icons and boxes to visually separate content sections, such as service types, enhancing readability and engagement on service and index pages.
10.	Optimized Console Logging:
•	Implement detailed logging to track progress during large-scale data processing, logging batches every 10 seconds. This will help monitor API usage and identify bottlenecks.

The main part of SEO is index pages and individual pages. Index pages are all the pages that fit into that type of page, for that category, on one page. For example, on my jobs website I have regions of Brisbane, Ipswich, Toowoomba, Gold Coast, regions of Southeast Queensland and the town inside that region, and then the trade, which creates a few different index page types. Index pages must be generated from lists, and not hardcoded at any time. 

Another example of this is my current service website, which has /meanings/meaning-of-name-Disaster Recovery - where Water Damage Restoration Service is a name, and then we have origin pages so origin/latin - these two index pages give two distinct ways to rank on Google. People who are searching for water damage restoration services, and people who are searching for emergency services for Disaster Recovery Services.

Locations: 
Brisbane, Ipswich, Toowoomba, Somerset Region, Brisbane CBD, Scenic Rim, Gold Coast, and Redland Bay.
Define Service Locations Clearly: Consider restructuring the section that lists locations. Instead of only listing “Brisbane, Ipswich, Toowoomba, etc.,” clarify that each location will have dedicated, SEO-optimized pages. This can include a heading like "Targeted Service Locations" followed by a brief description of what each page will include (e.g., local testimonials, service-specific FAQs).   
•	Use Sub-Sections for Each Major Region: Organize suburbs/towns within each region into bullet points or a table to improve readability. For example:
•	Brisbane CBD:
o	Suburbs: Fortitude Valley, Spring Hill, Petrie Terrace, etc.
•	Gold Coast:
o	Suburbs: Advancetown, Alberton, Arundel, etc.
Include SEO Focus: Add a note that each location page will be SEO-optimized for local keywords, aiming to improve rankings in each specific suburb or region.

Detailed Service Descriptions:
•	Highlight Core Services: Since the list of services is extensive, prioritize core services (e.g., Water Damage Restoration, Fire Damage Restoration, Mould Remediation) at the top. Provide a brief description under each core service to guide content creators on what specific details to include (e.g., methods, tools, benefits).
•	Service-Location Pairing: Create an example or a template for how to combine service descriptions with location-specific information. This would help ensure each page provides unique, location-relevant content.
•	Structured Data: Include a recommendation to implement structured data for each service page. This would help with search engine indexing and could improve click-through rates in local searches.

SEO and Page Generation:
•	Clearer Keyword Targeting Strategy: Reframe the SEO keywords section to focus on primary, secondary, and tertiary keywords. This could look like:
o	Primary Keywords: Water Damage Restoration Brisbane, Flood Restoration Gold Coast
o	Secondary Keywords: Emergency Water Cleanup Ipswich, Mould Remediation Services Toowoomba
•	Page Type Definitions: Specify the types of pages to be generated (e.g., Home, Location Index, Service Index, Individual Service in Location) and define content goals for each to streamline development and improve content consistency.

Additional Usability and Performance Enhancements:
•	Performance Optimization Notes: Reiterate the importance of optimizing JSON and build processes to handle high page counts effectively. Since this document involves building up to 5k+ pages, a small section with best practices for build performance could be valuable.
•	User Journey and Conversion Focus: Add a quick note on incorporating calls-to-action (CTAs) on each page, such as "Contact Us for Brisbane Water Damage Restoration" or "Schedule an Emergency Mold Cleanup in Gold Coast." This could boost conversion rates by making it easy for visitors to act.

Modular Component Guidance:
•	Clearer Component Usage: Suggest component reuse across pages where applicable (e.g., a “Service Overview” component for each major service and location). This modularity will help reduce maintenance overhead and improve consistency.
•	Example Structure for Components: For instance, the roadmap could mention a structure like:
o	Header Component: Location/Service-specific information
o	Service Details Component: Service-specific benefits, techniques, and tools
o	Contact CTA Component: Location-specific contact information and a form or button

—--------------------------------------------

You must be as detailed as possible with your SEO, abusing the fact that Google is very likely to rank pages that have exact phrase matches to keywords, for example “Water Damage Restoration Service Brisbane” for my Disaster Recovery Qld website, which helps me rank for that question across all of the names in my database with a total of 100k pages, you can see how index pages, and then individual pages of that page type can really start to create scale.

When coding be extremely mindful of typescript errors, and not taking into account that some responses could be null, please also optimize the build time as much as possible, and fact that some JSON responses from open ai gpt-4o-mini may be malformed. Please also make sure to have detailed console logs and optimize the ways you build the project to ensure that there are a lot of calls per minute. I have a huge rate limit of 40k calls a minute on gpt-4o-mini so please abuse that.

I have included the documentation for gpt-4o-mini, JSON mode - the idea here is to fill the prompt inside the JSON mode both with information from the CSV to guide the prompt, and objects which make sense for the task at hand, i have attached an example of my baby names one so you know what to do

You should add all this information together to generate as many pages as possible, both the interesting data from the CSV and also the JSON responses from OpenAI in a templated programmatic SEO format which puts all of this information together in a modular, clean, modern way, using icons and boxes and shading to create a modular page packed full of interesting information. Focus on different types of pages such as origins pages, which are groups of index pages for names with the same origin, so we can rank for  “Water Damage Services”, “Fire and Smoke Remediation Services”, “Mould Remediation Services”, and “Additional Services” etc.

—--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Implement ISR so the website can be built again quickly and easily
Use NextJS, shadcn, and tailwind
Be very careful and wary of typescript errors
Remember some API responses may be null, or malformed,
When building, data that already exists should be ignored
You should make separate JSON files for each individual page, for example /towns/services should have a separate JSON File
Make sure you are generatingStaticParams - and not confusing dynamic generation and static generation, 
Be extremely efficient with how you build index pages, make sure you won’t timeout after the 60 seconds that nextjs gives as a standard timeout
Maximise build efficiency, speed, and complexity and modular nature of any pages which are generated for  SEO
